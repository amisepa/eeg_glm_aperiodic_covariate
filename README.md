# eeg_glm_aperiodic_covariate
conventional dB baseline correction in EEG timeâ€“frequency analysis can spuriously mix oscillatory changes with broadband (aperiodic) shifts when baseline aperiodic parameters differ. This repo simulates this effect and apply a GLM-based solution that includes the aperiodic offset and exponent as covariates.
